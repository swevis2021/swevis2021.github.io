# IEEE VIS 2021 Sweden Satellite
The visualization team at [Linköping University](https://liu.se) is excited to host a satellite event for [IEEE VIS](https://ieeevis.org) 2021 in beautiful Norrköping, Sweden, and we'd love for you to join us between October 24th and 29th, 2021!  We are starting to plan for the event, while also carefully monitoring the COVID-19 situation in Sweden and across Europe.  If you are potentially interested in joining us in Norrköping please fill out the information below.  We will contact you as plans take shape as well as to communicate any changes due to the pandemic. 

## Program
We will provide on-campus facilities to watch the live streams of VIS conference sessions.  Due to the time difference, these sessions will predominantly take place in the afternoon.  We will host an auxiliary program in the mornings to encourage networking and collaboration, consisting of a combination of demo sessions, seminar series, and lightning talks. We will also have [fika](https://visitsweden.com/what-to-do/food-drink/swedish-kitchen/all-about-swedish-fika/) each day.  Additionally, there will be a local social event in the [Visualization Center C](http://visualiseringscenter.se/en), sponsored by [Visual Sweden](https://www.visualsweden.se/en/) with a dinner and an evening at the dome theater. 

As soon as the program is finalized, we will update this page with more information.

## Logistics
The satellite event will take place at the Norrköping Campus of Linköping University.  Norrköping is a city located about 2h south of Stockholm and easy to reach by car, train, and plane.
